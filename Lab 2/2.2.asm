;Suppose the accumulator content is 25H and register B has 48H. Write a program to subtract the reg B from accumulator and store the result in reg C. Again swap the acc content and reg B content and subtract the reg B content from acc content. See the flag content and the reg content before and after the subtraction

MVI A, 25H
MVI B, 48H
SUB B

MOV C,A
MOV A,B
MOV B,C

SUB B
